- Clicking the globe icon opens a dropdown menu with the available languages.
- Selecting a language dynamically translates the content of the portfolio using JavaScript.
- Toast notifications provide immediate feedback when switching languages, even when selecting the current language.
- Background decorative images are unselectable to prevent accidental interactions.
- The selected language is stored in the browser's local storage for persistence across sessions.
